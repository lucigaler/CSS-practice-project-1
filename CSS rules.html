        <p>First, we will look at CSS Selectors. Each selector will target different HTML elements, so it is important to know when it is appropriate to use each one.</p>

          <caption>CSS Selectors and their purpose</caption>
          <thead>

      <section class="specificity">
        <p><strong>Specificity</strong> is an important feature to know when using CSS selectors. It refers to which selectors have priority over others, so that if more than one style could apply to a particular element, the browser will know which one to use.</p>
        <p>The general rule is that ID selectors are more important than class selectors, which in turn are more important than element selectors. Styling done directly in the HTML code, such as using the <span class="code">&lt;style&gt;</span> tag or inline styles, will override most CSS rules. Using <span class="code">!important</span> when defining a style will override any other styling, however, so this takes the #1 spot! </p>
      </section>

      <section class="properties">
        <p>Now that we understand selectors and specificity, let's have a look at the properties we can assign styles with!</p>

              <td>Changes the colour of the element targetted &mdash; CSS has 140 supported colour names</td>

            </tr>

              <td><span class="code">bold</span></td>
              <td>Changes the thickness of the letters &mdash; it is possible to use numerical values as well as <span class="code">bold</span> or <span class="code">normal</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><span class="code">text-align</span></td>

              <td><span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">1</span></td>
              <td>Changes the opacity of the text from <span class="code">1</span> - fully opaque - to <span class="code">0</span> - fully transparent</td>
            </tr>
